# Global Earthquake and Energy Analysis

## Project Overview
This project combines global earthquake data (2000-2023) with nuclear energy infrastructure information to explore risks and correlations. Using Python, advanced data processing, and visualization techniques, it delivers insights on disaster risks and energy safety. The findings aim to assist in decision-making for urban planning and disaster preparedness.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Exploration of earthquake trends and their proximity to nuclear plants.
- **Risk Assessment**: Insights on regions at high risk of disasters due to geological and energy-related factors.
- **Visualizations**: Interactive and static plots to communicate results effectively.

---

## Data
- **Earthquake Data**: Detailed records of global earthquakes from 2000 to 2023 (`Earthquake_2000_to_2023.csv`).
- **Nuclear Plants Data**: Locations and population exposure near nuclear facilities (`energy-pop-exposure-nuclear-plants-locations_plants.csv`).
